    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
       We are Beautiful ... is a project designed to lift the mystery
       that surrounds human genitalia. In many cultures and through a 
       lot of human history it has been taboo to look at other human
       genitalia. 
    </p>
    <p>
       We aim to change this by presenting educational, respectul
       and representative models of typical humans. You may <a 
       a href="{{ url_for("index.browse") }}">browse the collection of 3D models</a> 
       and you can even download and print these models on your own 
       3D printer.
    </p>
    <p>
       Our goal is to provide educational models that sex educators
       everywhere can download, print and use in their classes. Also,
       if you have questions about your own genitalia, have a look
       at other humans -- we come in many different shapes and
       sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
       Click on any model to view the 3D version of it or to download
       the model. We encourage you to find out more <a href="{{ url_for("index.about") }}">about
       this project</a> and <a href="{{ url_for("index.team") }}">our team</a>. Also, please
       consider making a small <a href="{{ url_for("index.donate") }}">donation</a> to help
       cover our operating costs.
